# RsMake C++ Build System

RsMake is a command-line based build system for C++, written solely in Rust. It is intended to be a quick and easy build system for developers 
to easily maintain and manage their project.

RsMake is a hierarchical build system which constructs a directed acyclic graph from the contents of its recipe files.

By writing the minimal amount of boilerplate code, a user gets a well equipped build environment with easily modifiable runtime configurations.

RsMake differs from the typical build systems in that there are no "targets"...

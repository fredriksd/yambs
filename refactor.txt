RsMake:
   * Create Output / Log class for handling stdout and stderr messages?
   * Look into using a log framework to help with this? spdlog?
      * log crate (https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/)
   * RsMake is currently dynamically linking stdlibc++ to executables and libraries. Should this be statically instead?
   * Use anyhow?

Dependency:
   * Does not make sense that `add_library_name` makes the name prepended with "lib" and suffixed with ".a".
   * Need to check this up with mmk_parser; it is not consistent there either.

Utility:
   * Remove create_file?


Bugs: 
   [fredrik@Core ~/dev/test/cpp/AStarPathFinder (master)●1⌗1]$ ~/dev/private/rsmake/target/debug/rsmake -g build-rsmake -c c++17,debug
   gives the following error:
      * error: Invalid value for '-g <input-file>': The path "/home/fredrik/dev/test/cpp/AStarPathFinder/build-rsmake" does not exist
   This is a bit confusing. Should be cleaned up.

Environment variables:
   RSMAKE_GENERATOR_BINARY (make, ninja, etc...)
   CXX
   CC?
   * List required environment variables set for RsMake
